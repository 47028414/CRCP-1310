Elsa's Snow

After seeing the snow affect used at the Frozen Live at the Hyperion Show in Disney’s California Adventure Park, I was inspired by the idea of having live actors interact with projections. For years I had seen projections be used for backdrops and a wide variety of other effects on stage, but this was the first application I’ve seen that was truly personal to a character and played such a vital role in their development. One thing I found lacking was that the actor had no control over this expression of her character.
For my project, I wanted to experiment with creating a program designed for xbox kinect that registers the actor’s movement and uses that movement to create imagery that is insighted by their actions. The goal is that this program will give the actor more freedom of expression for their character, while also adding to visual interest.
